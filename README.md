A Flutter package to quickly fetch Forex prices and perform currency cinversions.

## Features

 - List of all forex prices in the open market.
 - Convert money from one currency to another using open market prices.

## Getting started

```dart
import 'package:forex_currency_conversion/forex_currency_conversion.dart';
```

## Usage


If you want the latest prices of all currencies with respect to price of USD, you can do it with minimal hassle.

```dart
  final fx = Forex();
  Map<String, double> allPrices = await fx.getAllCurrenciesPrices();
  print("Exchange rate of PKR: ${allPrices['PKR']}");
  print("Exchange rate of EUR: ${allPrices['EUR']}");
  print("Exchange rate of TRY: ${allPrices['TRY']}");
```

If you want to check the list of all the supported currencies, you can do it easily.

```dart
  final fx = Forex();
  List<String> availableCurrencies = await fx.getAvailableCurrencies();
  print("The list of all available currencies: ${availableCurrencies}");
```

For a simple currency conversion, you can use the following method for instant conversion. You must make sure you are entering only supported currencies, which can be obtained through the method provided above.

```dart
  final fx = Forex();
  double myPriceInPKR = await fx.getCurrencyConverted("USD", "PKR", 252.5);
  print("252.5 USD in PKR: ${myPriceInPKR}");
```

You can initialize the class with default values for source and destination currencies. Also for the number of decimal places.

```dart
  final fx = Forex(defaultDestinationCurrency: 'PKR', defaultSourceCurrency: 'EUR', defaultNumberOfDecimals: 1);
```

## Additional information

This package uses real-time currency rates from a third-party prices provider convertmymoney.com. The forex prices are bound to their terms and conditions.
